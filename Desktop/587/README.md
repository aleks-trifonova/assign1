## Step-by-Step Instructions ##

16

### Step 0: Create a GitHub Account ###

17

​

18

If you do not already have a [GitHub](https://github.com/) account, create one now.

19

This should only take a couple minutes, and it's free.

20

If you already have an account, you can use your existing account.
GIthub has the ability to create private repositories but that is a features that is available along with their premium accounts.

21

​

22

### Step 1: Fork this Repository ###

23

​

24

Go to the [main repository webpage](https://github.com/csun-comp587-s20/assign1) for this repository.

25

[Fork](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/) this repository over to **your own account**, using the button circled below:

27

​

28

A fork is effectively a copy of the entire repository, frozen at the point when you created the fork.

29

You own this copy and have complete control over it.

30

Notably, if the original repository changes, your fork will **not** automatically change; you created the copy from a specific point in time.

31

We'll come back to this in a bit.

32

​

33

### Step 2: Clone your Fork ###

34

​

35

> The remainder of these steps assume you're using the `git` command on the command-line.

36

> On Linux, this should be available through your package manager if it isn't already installed.

37

> On Mac, `git` is bundled with the normal developer tools, and on recent versions merely typing `git` will prompt you to install the developer tools.

38

> On Windows, these commands can be downloaded [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

39

> There are also a number of GUI tools out there for handling `git`.

40

> You may use whatever you want.

41

​

42

Go to your main GitHub page (should be `github.com/your_username`), and click the `Repositories` tab.

43

Your fork should be listed here.

44

Click on your fork, and then click the `Clone or download` button, circled below:
